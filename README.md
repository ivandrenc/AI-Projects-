# Solutions for CS50 AI Course with Python #
Note: Please first try to solve the projects by your own before you see the solutions. Happy coding!

### Project 6b: Questions ###
Question answering system making use of tf-idf (short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus).

### Project 6a: Parser ###
Natural language processing program for determining the structure of english sentences using NLTK

### Project 5: Traffic ###
Traffic road signs classifier using Tensorflow and convolutional neural networks. [Data set provided by German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark ](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news)

### Project 4b: Nim ###
Nim is a simple multiplayer game, in this program the opponent will be an AI trying always to win using the Q-learning key formula, so the AI can learn and make progress through experience and playing 10000 games. 

### Project 4a: Shopping ###
Nearest-Neighbor classifier given information about a user — how many pages they’ve visited, whether they’re shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, etc. the classifier will predict whether or not the user will make a purchase. For this program we will measure with sensitivity and specifity for avoiding/minimizing misleading statistics.

### Project 3: Crossword ###
Crossword generator enforcing node-consistency, arc-consistency (ac3) satisfying unitary constraints as well binary constraints, and implementing the backtrack algorithm. 

### Project 2b: Heredity ###
AI to predict the likelihood that a person has a specific genetic trait using a bayesian network and joint probabilities.

### Project 2a: Pagerank ###
Implementation of the pagerank algorithm from google for ranking web pages by importance. 

### Project 1b: Minesweeper ###
Minesweeper game implementation using propositional logic and knowledge bases. Thanks to the knowledge bases the AI can make correct moves and win the game in almost all cases.

### Project 1a: Knights ###
Using propositional logic and knowledge bases this program solves logic puzzles and through a recursive function it considers all possible models, and returns a true statement if the knowledge base entails the query, and returns a false statement otherwise.

### Project 0b: Tic-tac-toe ###
Using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning this program creates a tic tac toe game with adversary agent. 

### Project 0a: Degrees ###
According to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game, anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film that two actors both starred in. This program finds out how many degrees of separation two actors have using Breadth-first search (BFS).
